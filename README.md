# **HyperionVM**: A Stealth Virtual Machine for Low-Level Memory Manipulation

## Overview

**HyperionVM** is a high-performance, custom WinAPI virtual machine (VM) designed for low-level memory operations and process manipulation, mainly for bypassing SafeGuard while being inspired by SXVM. By re-implementing key Windows API functions and providing a flexible environment for C/C++ code, HyperionVM allows developers and researchers to bypass modern antivirus software, emulate system behaviors, and interact with processes and memory in an efficient and stealthy way.

## Features & Capabilities

---
### Key Features:
- **Function and Memory Management**: Custom implementations of WinAPI functions for flexible, stealthy memory manipulation and operations.
- **API Bypass**: Avoid detection by bypassing traditional hooks and high-level system calls used by antivirus software by calling functions from our state rather than Windows.
- **Advanced Emulation**: Custom virtual machine environment designed for deep system-level emulation, hopefully once I get around to it, HVM will support majority of the needed WinAPI functions.

### Key Components:
- **Security Evasion**: Uses unique implementations of common Windows functions to avoid detection by advanced antivirus software.

### Use Cases:
- **Security Research**: Bypass antivirus detection and analyze malicious software in a controlled environment.
- **Sealth Software Development**: Build software that interacts with memory and processes without triggering security alerts.
